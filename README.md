Implementation Report

This project consists of a complete FPS-style camera system that applies OpenTK and OpenGL. The camera has the ability to move simultaneously with the WASD motion in relation to camera alignment, mouse-look controls (can be tilted up and down and turned sideways) and the ability to zoom in and out using the mouse scroll wheel. Frame rate independence Movement computation Delta time provides the same speed on all hardware. The camera is clamped with the pitch ranging between -89deg and +89deg so that it does not flip itself and the field of view varies dynamically among 30deg to 90deg. The scene can be used to show that a rotating cube has Phong lighting (ambient, diffuse, and specular terms) and shows that that the transformation matrices (model, view and projection) and lighting calculations in the fragment shader are correct.

The greatest problem that was faced was making sure that all the camera controls operated at the same time without any conflicts. First, the ability to combine a mouse movement with camera rotation and at the same time, have a smooth WASD movement necessitated the sensitivity of the camera front vector and cross products in the lateral movement. The other issue was to handle the transformation pipeline properly- the vertex shader uses the inverse transpose of the model matrix to calculate the normals in the right way that the object should be lit. Also, a control structure that uses FPS-like controls needed to process the initial mouse movement to avoid abrupt camera movements. Light also had to be carefully adjusted in terms of ambient, diffuse and specular coefficients to provide aesthetically satisfactory results. On the whole, the modular design that includes independent classes to represent the shader, cube geometry, and main game loop allowed easily debugging and developing in cycles.
